# AI Matrix Solver

- This repository contains 2 implementations of a matrix solver using AI algorithms based on the story of the 1999 movie "The Matrix"
   - One implementation handles more constraints than the other and is OO principles (written fully in Java)
   - The other uses the logic programming paradigm and is written in prolog
